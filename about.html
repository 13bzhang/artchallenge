About the aRt Challenge
</h1>

<p>
The aRt Challenge is a game to solve a mystery about a stolen painting. Each level of the game can be solved used using <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R programming</a>, the internet, and your brain. 
</p>

<p>
You can use any programming language to solve the riddles, but we recommend you try R. We think it'd be a good learning experience. Though you may be frustrated at times. Currently there are 8 levels to the game; more will be available soon. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, we're big fans of <a href="http://notpron.org/notpron/">notpron</a> and the <a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/">Python Challenge</a>.
