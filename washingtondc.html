Back in your Washington, D.C. office, you wait -- not so patiently -- for the next lead. You stayed in Paris for another three days to locate the source of the phone call; however, you were unsuccessful. Agent Lee has some suspicions about which criminal organizations are involved but those are merely suspicions.

</p>
