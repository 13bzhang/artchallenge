<h1>Resources for R</h1>

<h3><b>What is R?</b></h3> 

<p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">Wikipedia</a>, R is "a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis." To data scientists, it's bread or butter.</p>

<h3><b>How do I install R?<b></h3>

<p>R is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux. Did we mention it's also free? Head over to the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Project</a> to download and install. Some people refer to work in base R (or in the terminal), but others like to work in an IDE. If you're among the latter, you might want to try out <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">R Studio</a>.</p>
