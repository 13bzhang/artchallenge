You have studied the said painting, now named Painting X, for several days now. It looks very, very similar to the stolen painting. Then again, you only have photographs of "Garden in Provence" to work with. Today, the lab results from the chemical analysis of Painting X finally arrive:
</p>

<p>
Sample No.: 283403   <br>  
Ol: 3.5434   <br>
On: 2.2423   <br>
Op: 1.6793   <br>
Tg: 3.8935  
</p>

<p>
You have an <a href="data/data1.csv">existing dataset</a> of similar chemical analysis from 53 oil paintings of various time periods. So you plan to use linear regression to predict the age of the painting. 
</p>

<p>
Hint No. 1: lm() might be useful. 
</p>

<p>
Hint No. 2: What is the predicted year of Painting X's creation?
